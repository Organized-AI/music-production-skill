for those of you that are new to this, a sample is a short audio recording that can be used in a track.

capture sounds around you with the built-in microphone, or use the stereo line-input to sample your favorite synthesizer, connect your CM–15 mic, even your phone!

sampling is a powerful tool that can make your track truly unique. sample something then record it using K.O.II’s powerful built in sequencer!

enter sample mode

to record a sound, press (SAMPLE) to enter sample mode. you will see all the buttons light up. the leds will blink to let you know you are in sample mode.

sample

press and hold a pad while in sample mode to start recording your sample. once a sample has been recorded to a pad it will stop blinking and light up to let you know it has been recorded to.

pro-tip! after recording, audition a sample by pushing the pad again.

add more samples

while in SAMPLE mode, you can continue capturing samples to additional pads.

stereo/mono/l/r

pressing (minus) or (plus) when sampling allows you to choose between:

mic

line in mono (in)

line in stereo (in)

resample mono (rsp)

resample stereo (rsp)

line in left mono (L.IN)

line in right mono (R.IN)

input level

the (knobX) knob controls input level.

threshold

the (knobY) knob adjusts the threshold allowing you to trigger the recording to start only when you make just the right amount of noise.

re-take sample

record something that’s not quite right? get a second chance by pressing sample again and retaking it!

hands free sampling

run out of hands? not a problem! press (shift) and a pad to have ko2 hold the pad for you!

try combining this with the resample source to sample chords and individual sounds.

resample pattern

while in sample mode, engage hands free sampling by holding (shift) and pressing a pad then press (play).

ko2 will then sample the length of the currently selected pattern.

pro-tip! jump straight into sampling while your pattern is playing to start sampling it with the resample source!

resample bars

to sample a specific number of bars just press (minus) or (plus) when hands free sampling is engaged.

this will then sample the number of selected bars once (play) has been pressed.

stop sampling

to stop the hands free sampling, press (sample) while a sample is being recorded.

exit sample mode

exit sample mode by hitting (MAIN).

permanently delete sample

samples are stored automatically and can only be deleted by removing them in the SOUND menu.

holding (ERASE) + (SOUND) will delete the currently selected sample from the device.

resample

use resample to take multiple samples and combine them into one longer sample.

you can also use resample to stack and time stretch whole sections of your beat.

sound library

every time you sample something, it is stored inside the sound library.

samples are stored in the next available slot and automatically assigned in order.

pro-tip! if you want to sample your favorite acid synth, you can explicitly choose a destination for it by holding sound, typing a number on the pads (like 3..0..3..), pressing (enter), then hit sample!

[sample tool](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/functions#10.2-sample-tool)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

to transfer audio files to use as samples to/from a computer, use the file transfer tool.

sample tool

connect K.O.II via usb-c and go to:

[teenage.engineering/apps/ep-sample-tool](https://teenage.engineering/apps/ep-sample-tool)

here are instructions on [how to use the sample tool](https://support.teenage.engineering/hc/en-us/articles/11639171890204)

pro-tip! K.O. II now supports samples with lower than native samplerate. when transferring samples through the sample-tool the audio file sample-rate will be preserved if lower than 46875. good for saving space on your KOII and getting a lo-fi sound! this means you can fit approx 50 minutes of 11.025 kHz/16-bit mono into 64 MB!

[chop](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/functions#10.3-chop)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

a great technique when making beats is to experiment with chopping up a drum rhythm or a chord-progression into smaller pieces. play them back in random order using the pads until you find something that has a groove to it.

chop it up

if you want to chop your sample up across different pads, you can choose between AUTO-CHOP, which lets K.O II do it for you, or LIVE CHOP to do it manually.

(SHIFT) + (SAMPLE) = (CHOP)

auto-chop

intelligently divide your sample into individual slices, they will be assigned to as many pads as the sample needs.

press (GROUPA)-(GROUPD) to select the group you wish to AUTO-CHOP. this will reset any pad assignments so make sure you pick an empty group or one you are happy to write over.

the sample chop point is auto detected using beat tracking, populating from bottom left to top right. use (minus)/(plus) to decide on the number of slices.

live chop

If you know where you want to slice, try LIVE CHOP. by using this hands-on approach, you have direct control over the placement of your sample's cuts.

when in CHOP mode, press a pad to CHOP. the break will be assigned depending on the amount of time between pressing pads. keep pressing pads as the sample plays to chop it up across your pads.

in and outputs

if it's not sounding quite right you can refine the exact in and out points of each chop by selecting the pad and turning (knobX) and (knobY) to set the precise start and end points.

pro-tip! holding down (SHIFT) while turning the (knobX) and (knobY) knobs will allow for finer control so you can find the perfect start and end points.

[timing](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/functions)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

sense of rhythm or not, quantization to the rescue! TIMING allows you manually select the note interval of the step sequencer, as well as enable or disable quantized recording.

sound note interval illustration

1 = 1 step per bar2 = 2 steps per bar

4 = 4 steps per bar8 = 8 steps per bar

16 = 16 steps per bar32 = 32 steps per bar

the 8T and 16T are triplet variations.

8T = 12 steps per bar 16T = 24 steps per bar

timing

to change the note interval press TIMING.

set note interval

the (knobX) knob controls the note interval.

set swing

the (knobY) knob controls swing.

(only applies to1/8 and 1/16 note intervals).

quantize/free time

(minus) and (plus) toggle between quantize (minus) and free time (plus).

quantised recording will always snap whatever you record to the chosen note interval.

free time will keep things loose and record exactly as you played it.

[10.4.1](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/functions#10.4.1-note-repeat)

[note repeat](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/functions#10.4.1-note-repeat)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

it should be easy to record a hi-hat! if you hold down the TIMING while pressing a pad, your sample will play back according to the chosen note interval.

note repeat

hold TIMING and press a pad to trigger note repeat for that pad.

pro-tip! this is pressure sensitive when [velocity is enabled](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/how-to#12.1-enable-velocity-sensitivity)!

held note repeat

press (timing), then hold (shift) and press a pad to hold the note repeat on that pad.

pro tip! note repeat 1 can be used to play back a sampled loop.

to disengage the held note repeat, just follow the same combination with the same pad.

[10.4.2](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/functions#10.4.2-timing-correct)

[timing correct](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/functions#10.4.2-timing-correct)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

maybe everything was perfect except for one hit, but you don’t want to quantize everything because you love the beat?

use the (TIMING) (CORRECT) function to quantize individual pads or even individual notes. this way, things will fall into place without ruining any magic.

timing correct

open timing correct by pressing (SHIFT) and (TIMING).

quantize pad

when stopped, press a pad to quantize all the steps recorded to that pad.

live quantize

while playing, hold a pad during playback to quantize the notes played while held (the number of corrected notes will show on the display).

set note interval

turn (knobx) to adjust the note interval you wish to correct your notes to.

set swing

when the note interval is set to 8 or 16, turn (KNOBY) to adjust the swing.

[10.5](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/functions#10.5-loop)

[loop](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/functions#10.5-loop)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

loops create a repetitive pattern that can be incredibly catchy, memorable or annoying.

think of them as a foundation to layer additional instruments and sounds.

they can also be tweaked and varied over time, and give a defining character to your song.

the LOOP function is inspired by our beloved [OB–4 magic radio.](https://teenage.engineering/products/ob-4)

enter loop

press (SHIFT) and (TEMPO) to create a loop.

pro-tip: hold (SHIFT) and (TEMPO) to set the length of the loop. the loop starts when you hold both buttons and ends when you release them.

slide loop

use the (KNOBX) knob to slide the loop position back and forth. sliding is tempo locked.

the display will show the position of the loop.

set loop length

when in loop mode use the (KNOBY) knob to set your loop length.

exit loop

press (TEMPO) to exit the loop directly or press (main) to exit the loop on the next bar.
