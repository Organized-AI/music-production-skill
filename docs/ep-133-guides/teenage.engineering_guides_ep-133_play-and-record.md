ko2 allows for fast and easy live recording so you can quickly get your ideas down.

record with count in

while K.O.II is not playing press and release (record) then press (play) to hear a four beat count-in and start recording.

hit the pads to record your beat!

stop recording

once you are done recording press (play) again to stop the recording and pause your beat.

otherwise, press (RECORD) to keep the beat going but stop recording.

record without count in

if you want to start recording without a count-in

you can press (RECORD) and (PLAY) together.

record from pattern start

to record from the start of the pattern, rather than the current bar press (record) to enter record arm then (shift) and (play).

pattern length

by default K.O.II will be set to a 1 bar pattern length.

if you want to record a longer pattern press (RECORD) then (minus) or (plus).

K.O.II supports pattern lengths of up to 99 bars per group.

duplicate pattern length

to duplicate the length of your pattern press (record) to enter record arm then hold shift and (plus).

this will duplicate notes in the existing pattern and double the length.

change pattern length while playing

while playing you can change pattern length on the fly by holding (RECORD) and pressing (MINUS) or (PLUS).

overdub

to record over an existing pattern, press (PLAY) to start the pattern then hold (RECORD) and hit the pads to record notes into the beat.

in case you make a mistake you can easily erase it! find out more in the next sections.

overwrite record

to overwrite an existing recording press (record), (erase) and (plus).

this will delete the existing recording and overwrite it with the new one.

[9.2](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/play-and-record#9.2-step-sequence)

[step sequence](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/play-and-record)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

K.O.II sequences per step. this allows you to get super precise sequences when using smaller note intervals, while also punching-in basic sequences super fast, at higher note intervals.

step

while K.O.II is not playing, use (minus) and (plus) to step through the steps in your pattern.

record to a step

hold (RECORD) and press a pad to record the chosen pad to that step.

when a pad is recorded to a given step it will light up.

erase note

you can remove unwanted sounds and notes by holding (ERASE) then pressing the pad corresponding to the unwanted note or sound.

erase note while playing

you can also remove unwanted sounds and notes by holding (ERASE) while playing then pressing the pad corresponding to the unwanted note or sound.

free nudge

when in free time hold (SHIFT) and the desired pad then press (minus) or (plus) to nudge the recorded note in ticks.

pro-tip! a tick is the smallest time increment that the sequencer in K.O.II uses. it operates at 96 ppqn (parts per quarter note), meaning there are 96 ticks per beat. this means that the step resolution of K.O.II is 24 ticks, same as OP–Z.

quantised nudge

when in quantize mode hold (SHIFT) and the desired pad.

then press (minus) or (plus) to nudge the recorded note in steps.

note velocity

hold (shift) and turn (knobx) to change the note velocity of all notes in a chosen step.

note duration

hold (shift) and turn (knoby) to change the note duration of all notes in a chosen step.

the maximum note duration is one bar and the minimum is one tick.

[9.3](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/play-and-record#9.3-keys)

[keys](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/play-and-record#9.3-keys)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

sometimes you love a sample so much you want to play it all the time. KEYS mode let’s you play a selected sample across a 12 note keyboard, either on your K.O.II’s pads or a [connected midi keyboard](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/how-to#12.8-control-koii-with-a-midi-keyboard).

active keys

select a pad you want to activate then press (KEYS) to chromatically transpose the selected pad across the 12 pads.

octave

hold (KEYS) and press (minus) or (plus) to select the octave.

when exceeding the highest octave, the notes from the same octave will repeat allowing you to keep playing.

root note

holding (KEYS) and selecting a pad will transpose the scale.

record note

to record a note to a step, hold down (record) and press the pad that you wish to have play on that step.

erase note

you can remove unwanted sounds and notes by holding (ERASE) then pressing the pad corresponding to the unwanted note or sound.

live record notes

to live record a note start recording by pressing (RECORD) then (PLAY) and punch out some notes into your pattern.

[9.4](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/play-and-record#9.4-fader)

[fader](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/play-and-record)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

the fader allows you to control and record various effects and parameters in your pattern.

fader parameter

hold (FADER) and a pad to change the fader parameter of your chosen group.

the fader assignments can be found printed above the pads.

pro-tip: hold (fader) to see the current recorded fader automations. assignments with automations will blink.

rec fader movement

fader movements can also be recorded.

holding (RECORD) and moving the FADER will record the fader’s movement into your beat.

pro-tip: when step sequencing, hold (record) and move the fader to record the position of the fader to the current step. this is latching, not momentary.

reset virtual fader

press (SHIFT) and (FADER) to reset the fader’s virtual position to the default position for all fader assignments in the current group (RES shows on screen).

pressing this combo again will undo the reset (SET shows on screen).

erase fader automation

while K.O.II is not playing, holding (ERASE) and (FADER) for 2 seconds will reset all fader levels for the selected group and pattern (FDR blinks on screen followed by DEL).

precise fader adjustments

holding (SHIFT) and moving the fader will adjust the value of the fader more precisely,

allowing you to get just the right sound!

group project volume

holding a group pad and moving the fader will change the group’s project volume. this is independent from the fader’s “level” assignment which controls the pattern’s volume.

the group project volume can not be automated, while the pattern level can be. any changes to the project level apply across all patterns and scenes in the current project.

copy

when in main, press (SHIFT) and (GROUPC) to copy (press once for BAR and twice for pattern. the current bar will be copied.

pro-tip! you can navigate through bars using (SHIFT) and (minus)/(plus)

paste

press (SHIFT) and (groupD) to paste.

copy sounds

you can also copy sounds!

when in sound mode you can copy a sound from one pad to another by pressing (SHIFT) and (GROUPC) to copy from the currently selected pad, then selecting the pad you wish to paste to and pressing (SHIFT) and (GROUPD) to paste your sound to it.

copy sounds

when in sound mode you can copy all sounds in a group by pressing (SHIFT) and (GROUPC) twice.

you can then select the group you wish to paste to and press (SHIFT) and (GROUPD) to paste your sounds to it.

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

ERASE removes recorded regrets, fader failures, whole projects, scenes, patterns, samples, or everything you’ve ever recorded.

playback erase

during playback, hold (ERASE) and the pad you wish to clear to remove note(s) or pad(s) played as the pattern runs.

pro-tip! hold down multiple pads while pressing erase to erase them all at once - this can even be done with notes recorded in keys mode!

erase note

while K.O.II is not playing, hold (erase) and a pad until TRK blinks on the screen to erase all the notes recorded on that pad in the pattern.

erase pattern

hold (ERASE) and the group pads (GROUPA) \- (GROUPD) until PTN blinks on the screen to erase the current patterns.

erase scene

hold (ERASE) and (MAIN) for two seconds, if the current scene is empty and not included in the song list, it will be deleted and DEL will blink on the screen. otherwise, the contents will be cleared and CLR will show instead.

erase project

while not playing, hold (main), (erase) and the pad containing the project you wish to erase.

erase sound

hold (ERASE) and (SOUND) until SND blinks on the screen to permanently remove the currently selected sample from device memory.

system settings

pressing (SHIFT) and (ERASE) will open the system settings. use  (minus)/(plus)  and ENTER to navigate the settings tree then ENTER to set your option.

alternatively [the codes](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/system) can be typed using the numpad and ENTER to confirm.

undo

pressing (SHIFT) and (GROUPB) will undo - when an undo is possible the umbrella will light up to let you know.

erase fader automation

while K.O.II is not playing, holding (ERASE) and (FADER) until FDR blinks on screen will erase fader automation for all assignments and set the fader position for all assignments to their current position (FDR blinks on screen followed by DEL).

erase fader movements live

while playing, holding (ERASE) and (FADER) will delete fader movements for all fader assignments. this will set the fader position for all assignments to their position when (ERASE) and (FADER) were first pressed.

[9.7](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/play-and-record#9.7-offset-notes)

[offset notes](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/play-and-record#9.7-offset-notes)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

sometimes you want to add a little more feeling or expression to your beat, or even just get weird. offsetting notes allows you to move them around to just the right point!

note offset

while K.O.II is not playing, hold (SHIFT) and the desired pad then press (minus) or (plus) to nudge the note.

when in quantize mode the notes will move corresponding to the note interval.

when in free time, the notes will move outside of the grid between the note intervals.
