EP–133 K.O.II is a 64 MB sampler and composer. just like it's pocket-sized predecessor PO-33 K.O!, this sampler is a mighty contender on the stage, in the studio and in the ring. sample directly from your favorite source using the built in mic or 3.5 mm input jack.

k.o.ii HIGHLIGHTs!

top side

on the top side of the unit, you will find all the inputs and outputs.

use the 3.5 mm stereo input to connect external instruments, tape recorders or audio from your phone. use the output to connect a stereo 3.5 mm cable to your sound system, mixer/soundcard or headphones.

input

use the 3.5 mm stereo input to connect external instruments, vinyl players, tape recorders or audio from your phone.

output

use the output to connect a stereo 3.5 mm cable to your sound system, mixer/soundcard or headphones.

INPUT EXAMPLE

sample from your phone by connecting it using a 3.5 mm cable into the 3.5 mm input.

INPUT EXAMPLE

connect a turntable and sample your favorite record. make sure to use an RIAA amplifier or a turntable that features a built-in amp.

output EXAMPLE

connect headphones directly into the output to monitor your beats.

outPUT EXAMPLE

connect a speaker directly into the output to knock out a crowd with your beats.

sync in and out offers great flexibility to play with external gear.

dual 8th note

use dual 8th note output to sync two pocket operators using a [splitter cable](https://teenage.engineering/store/slim-stereo-splitter-cable/). clock is sent on both tip (left channel) and ring (right channel).

16th note

use 16th note 'eurorack style' sync with start/reset on the ring (right channel). you can also use it to add another EP–133 in perfect sync.

sync 24

use sync24 to link up your vintage drum machines.

pro-tip: this requires a 3.5mm to din sync cable. a midi cable will not work.

midi

use midi-in and out to connect EP–133 to any midi controllable devices, as well as receive midi from any midi controllers, like a piano or drum pad.

usb-c

the usb-c port allows K.O. II to work as a midi device with clock and transport.

firmware

the usb is also used to transfer samples to and from your EP and [update firmware](https://teenage.engineering/apps/update).

file transfer

use the [EP SAMPLE TOOL](https://teenage.engineering/apps/ep-sample-tool) to carefully and automatically convert any sample/bitrate combo using a high-quality resampler then download them straight onto the device.
