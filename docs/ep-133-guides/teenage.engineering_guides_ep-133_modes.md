[modes](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

the device operates in three main modes: (SOUND), (MAIN) and (TEMPO).

[8.1](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes#8.1-sound)

[sound](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

SOUND is where you decide which sample to assign to each pad and delete stuff you don't need, as well as modify basic parameters like amplitude and pitch.

K.O.II can store up to 999 samples, or 64 MB, whichever comes first.

load sample

to load a sample onto a pad, select a group  (GROUPA) \- (GROUPD) then a pad.

change sound

press (minus) or (plus) to change the sound on that pad.

enter sound

alternatively, hold (sound) and enter the number of the sound you want using the pads.

pro-tip! you can preview the name of a sample by holding down the pad while in sound mode. a sample will only have a name if imported or renamed using the EP sample tool.

amplitude

the (knobX) knob controls amplitude/volume (AMP).

pitch

the (knoby) knob controls pitch (PTC).

jump in tens

pressing (SHIFT) and (minus)/(plus) will jump up the sample numbers in tens rather than one by one.

default sample

kicks are stored from 1-99. snares from 100-199. hi-hats from 200-299. percussion from 300-399.bass from 400-499.melodic sounds from 500-599.

out of the box K.O.II will come loaded with over 300 samples but you can of course record your own or download them to the device by using the EP sample tool!

SOUND mode also allows you to edit the sounds. these edit modes affect the sound only within the selected project and do not write-back to the sample itself.

[8.2](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes#8.2-sound-edit)

[sound edit](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes#8.2-sound-edit)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

select the sound you wish to edit, then press (SHIFT) and (SOUND). within this menu you can then navigate through 6 edit modes.

use (minus) and (plus) to navigate through the edit modes.

enter sound edit

press (SHIFT) and (SOUND) to enter sound edit.

change edit mode

use (minus) and (plus) to change the sound edit mode.

save sound edits

hold (SHIFT) and (SOUND) for two seconds to save any edits you have made to the current sound.

[8.2.1](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes#8.2.1-sound-mode)

[sound mode](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes#8.2.1-sound-mode)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

sound

sound is where you can adjust the way a sample is played and where it should sit in your stereo mix.

play mode

the (knobX) knob controls the play mode of the sample between oneshot, key and legato.

oneshot

oneshot is monophonic, and plays the whole sample, one at a time.

key

key is polyphonic, and allows you to play multiples of the same sample at once.

perfect for playing the same sample across a keyboard!

legato

legato is monophonic, and plays a sample one at a time. when changing the note while being held, it will continue playing from the same point as it was left off.

pan

the (knobY) knob controls pan. pan gradually adjusts whether the sample is played on the left, right or center audio channels.

[8.2.2](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes#8.2.2-trim)

[trim](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes#8.2.2-trim)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

trim

trim helps you to fine tune the start and end points of your sample, so that you can cut straight to the bit you wanted!

start and end points

the (knobX) knob controls the starting point of the sample.

the (knobY) knob controls the length of your sample.

[8.2.3](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes#8.2.3-envelope)

[envelope](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes#8.2.3-envelope)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

envelope

envelope helps adjust the playback of your sample, so that it fades in and out exactly as you need it to. creating soft pads or snappy snares!

attack and release

the (knobX) knob controls attack. attack allows you to fade in your sample or have it play exactly how it was recorded.

the (knoby) knob controls release. release will continue playing the sample after you let go of the pad or will cut it off immediately.

[8.2.4](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes#8.2.4-time)

[time](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

time

time mode is a powerful tool which allows you to match the bpm of your sample to that of your project!

time stretch mode

the (knobX) knob sets the time stretch mode (BPM or BAR).

bpm

BPM will stretch the sample to match the project tempo.

to do so it requires you to set the sample bpm.

BAR

BAR will stretch the sample, automatically fits it to the chosen time division of the project’s bpm.

if you choose 1 bar it stretches your sample to be 1 bar long. if you choose 2 bars it stretches your sample to be 2 bars long.

tempo

the (knobY) knob sets the sample tempo (BPM) or sample length (BAR).

sample tempo

pro-tip! to find the tempo of incoming audio hold (sample)and (tempo).

[8.2.5](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes#8.2.5-midi)

[midi](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes#8.2.5-midi)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

midi

midi is a protocol that allows you to connect your K.O.II to other musical instruments, controlling your K.O.II or the instrument or both!

midi channel

the (knobX) knob controls the MIDI channel the pad receives and sends to. this allows you to connect a series of external music devices and send note data to them all individually from different pads!

root note

the (knobY) knob controls the MIDI root note. this allows you to set the MIDI root note of your sample and ensure that the root note on the device matches with the root note on the sample.

for more information on how to configure midi, as well as what midi messages are sent and received, please see the[midi chart](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/system#14.-midi-implementation-chart).

[8.2.6](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes#8.2.6-mute-group)

[mute group](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/modes)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

mute group

a mute group allows you to group together all the samples you do not wish to have playing at the same time. when playing the samples in a mute group only the last pressed sound will play, cutting off any others that came before it.

pads in mute groups

here the pads will flash. press a pad to add it to the mute group. if a pad is in a mute group it will light up.
