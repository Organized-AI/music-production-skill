[sync two K.O.II units](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/how-to)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

((1)) get started

for this setup you will need two K.O.II devices and a 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm cable.

((2)) connect via sync

firstly, make sure that both K.O.II devices are set to 1/16 sync both in and out.

you can then plug the cable into the sync out on one K.O.II and the sync in on the other.

[12.5](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/how-to#12.5-sync-a-pocket-operator-to-koii)

[sync a pocket operator to K.O.II](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/how-to)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

((1)) connect K.O.II to the pocket operator

first plug one end of a 3.5 mm cable into the sync output on your K.O.II, then the other end into the input jack on the left side of your pocket operator.

((2)) set your pocket operator to sync 2

press the function button under the rightmost knob and the bpm button until the screen shows SY2.

this will listen for a sync pulse on the input jack and output stereo audio from the output jack.

((3)) enter system settings

enter system settings by pressing (shift) and (erase).

((4)) navigate to sync

use (minus) and (plus) to navigate to the sync settings, then press (enter) on the pads.

((6)) navigate to sync > out > 8

use (minus) and (plus) to navigate to ‘8’, then hit (enter).

((7)) sync 8

K.O.II will now send a 1/8 clock pulse on it’s sync-out jack, meaning that it can sync with any device that receives 1/8 clock.

((8)) press play

press play on your pocket operator then (play) on your K.O.II and the two will sync to the same BPM!

[12.6](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/how-to#12.6-sync-koii-to-a-pocket-operator)

[sync K.O.II to a pocket operator](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/how-to#12.6-sync-koii-to-a-pocket-operator)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

((1)) connect your pocket operator to K.O.II

for this setup you will need a 3.5 mm stereo (trs) to 2 x 3.5 mm mono (ts) cable.

connect the stereo end to the output of the pocket operator then plug the right channel (ring - red on our cables) into the input jack on your K.O.II and the left channel (tip - brown or white on our cables) into the sync input jack on your K.O.II.

((2)) set your pocket operator to sync 1

press the function button under the rightmost knob and the bpm button until the screen shows SY1.

this will send a sync pulse on the left channel (tip) of the output jack.

((3)) enter system settings

enter system settings by pressing (shift) and (erase).

((4)) navigate to sync

use (minus) and (plus) to navigate to the sync settings, then press (enter) on the pads.

((5)) navigate to sync > in

use (minus) and (plus) to navigate to ‘in’, then hit (enter).

((6)) navigate to sync > in > 8

use (minus) and (plus) to navigate to ‘8’, then hit (enter).

((7)) sync 8

K.O.II will now listen for a 1/8 clock pulse on it’s sync-in jack, meaning that it can sync with any device that sends 1/8 clock.

((8)) press play

press play on your pocket operator then (play) on your K.O.II and the two will sync to the same BPM!

pro-tip! with this setup you can add the K.O.II’s internal effects to the audio coming from the pocket operator!

[12.7](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/how-to#12.7-sync-koii-to-a-vintage-drum-machine)

[connect your K.O.II to the drum machine](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/how-to#12.7-sync-koii-to-a-vintage-drum-machine)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133)

((1)) connect your K.O.II to the drum machine

first plug one end of a 3.5 mm cable into the sync out on your vintage drum machine, then the other end into the sync input on your K.O.II.

some vintage drum machines use a standard called DIN-sync that requires an adaptor or special cable.

((2)) enter system settings

enter system settings by pressing (shift) and (erase).

((3)) navigate to sync

use (minus) and (plus) to navigate to the sync settings, then press (enter) on the pads.

((4)) navigate to sync > in

use (minus) and (plus) to navigate to ‘in’, then hit (enter).

((5)) navigate to sync > in > 24

use (minus) and (plus) to navigate to ‘24’, then hit (enter)

((6)) sync 24

K.O.II will now listen for a sync24 clock pulse on it’s sync-in jack, meaning that it can sync with any device that sends sync24 clock.

((7)) press play!

press play on your drum machine and K.O.II (play) at the same time and sync to the same BPM!

((8)) sync out to the drum machine

follow the same steps as before but instead connect the K.O.II’s sync out to the sync-in of your drum machine then navigate to sync > out > 24.

[12.8](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/how-to#12.8-control-koii-with-a-midi-keyboard)

[control K.O.II with a midi keyboard](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/how-to#12.8-control-koii-with-a-midi-keyboard)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

((1)) get started!

for this setup, depending on your midi keyboard you may need a 3.5 mm stereo (trs) to midi din cable. some midi keyboards have trs midi and thus a 3.5 mm trs cable can be used between the keyboard and the K.O.II.

for usb midi keyboards you will need a midi host (this is typically a computer connected over usb-c or a dedicated midi host box) between the K.O. II and the MIDI keyboard.

((2)) connect your midi keyboard

once you have your midi keyboard connected, K.O.II will detect any notes and light up the MIDI or usb icon (depending on what input is used) on the screen.

((3)) play the pads with the keyboard!

now, any notes you play on the keyboard will trigger the pads on K.O.II!

((4)) play one pad across the keyboard!

if you want to play one pad transposed across the keyboard then just press (keys)!

[12.9](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/how-to#12.9-seq-external-midi-with-koii)

[sequence external midi with K.O.II](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/how-to#12.9-seq-external-midi-with-koii)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

((1)) get started!

for this setup, depending on your midi device you may need a 3.5 mm stereo (trs) to midi din cable.

some midi devices have trs midi and thus a 3.5 mm trs cable can be used. alternatively for usb midi devices a usb-c cable can be used.

((2)) connect your midi device

once you have your midi device connected, K.O.II will be able to send midi notes to it.

((3)) set a pad as a midi channel

press (shift) and (sound) to enter sound edit mode.

((4)) set a pad as a midi channel

select a pad, then navigate to the pad’s midi settings using (minus) and (plus).

pro-tip! setting the value of a pad when holding (sound) to “000” will create an empty pad that can hold midi without stealing any voices.

((5)) change midi channel

use the (knobx) knob to change the midi channel that the pad will send to.

((6)) change midi root note

use the (knoby) knob to change the root note of the midi notes, this allows you to sync your midi to the root note of your sample.

((7)) done!

now, any notes you play or sequence on that pad will send midi to the chosen channel!

((8)) bonus: send or receive midi clock

to send or receive clock to or from the connected devices go to system settings by pressing (shift) and (erase) then navigate to MIDI > Clock and choose from off, on or out.
