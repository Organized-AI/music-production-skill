finally, the fun starts. let’s give your track some personality!

the (FX) button is where you'll find delay, reverb, distortion, chorus, filter, and compressor.

each group can send to one master fx and the sum of the mix is sent through a master compressor.

additionally, the live input from the line in can send to the chosen fx.

enter fx

press (FX) while playing.

choose fx

use (minus) and (plus) to navigate through the fx.

fx level

to adjust your FX use the fader.

move the FADER to adjust the amount of fx on the current group.

solo

while playing, hold (FX) and press a group pad to solo that group.

pro tip! hold (FX) and multiple group pads to solo multiple groups at once.

[delay](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/effects#11.1-delay)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

delay

delay is like echo. it repeats the original sound multiple times to make it sound like you are somewhere like a valley or a fish bowl!

length

turn the (knobx) knob to adjust the length of your delay. this will change the time between repetitions.

feedback

to adjust your FX use the fader. turn the (knobY) knob to adjust the feedback of your delay. this will change how many times it repeats.move the FADER to adjust the amount of fx on the current group.

[reverb](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/effects#11.2-reverb)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

reverb

reverb can make it sound like you are in a massive church or a tiny room. turn it up and hear your sounds wash away like waves in the ocean!

length

turn the (knobX) knob to adjust the length of your reverb. this changes the size of the room.

color

turn the (knobY) knob to adjust the color of your reverb. this will filter out the high or low frequencies to make the reverb ‘darker’ or ‘brighter’.

reverb length

reverb emulates the sound of a space, from a small room to a cathedral.

[11.3](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/effects#11.3-distortion)

[distortion](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/effects#11.3-distortion)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

distortion

rock out with distortion, beat up your beat and punch it down!press (FX) while playing.

drive

turn the (knobX) knob to adjust the drive of your distortion, overdriving your sounds more or less.

color

turn the (knobY) knob to adjust the color of your distortion, this will filter out and resonate the high or low frequencies making the distortion even crazier.

distortion

distortion clips the loudest parts of a waveform creating a warm, fuzzy sound.

[chorus](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/effects#11.3-chorus)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

chorus

spread things out and get wavy with chorus. turn this up to thicken up your chords and get freaky with your drums!

modulation

turn the (knobX) knob to adjust the modulation of your chorus. this is the rate at which it will move the sound around.

feedback

turn the (knobY) knob to adjust the feedback of your chorus. this will control how prominent the effect is by feeding the signal back into itself. turn it up and hear it ring!

chorus

chorus multiplies your audio and makes it sound richer.

[filter](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/effects#11.5-filter)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

filter

looking for a more mellow sound? try the filter! filters are a great way of removing high or low frequencies and changing the character of a sound.

cutoff

turn the (knobX) knob to adjust the cutoff. this will set the range of frequencies to be cut. turn left to cut the highs and right to cut the lows.

resonance

turn the (knobY) knob to adjust the resonance. this emphasises the filter and can create an awesome sweeping sound. try turning it up and then moving the cutoff using the (knobX) knob!

filter

the filter allows you to shape your sound, by cutting and boosting certain frequencies.

[compressor](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/effects#11.6-compressor)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

compressor

punch down drums and keep your dynamics in check with the compressor!

drive

turn the (knobX) knob to adjust the drive. this controls how loud the audio going into the compressor is.

speed

turn the (knobY) knob to adjust the speed. this changes how fast the compressor is able to squash your sounds. turn up the drive and speed to hear your sounds get punched in the face by the compressor.

compressor

the compressor pushes down any loud portions of incoming audio while bringing up the overall volume, allowing you to reduce dynamics and add more punch!

[11.7](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/effects#11.7-punch-in-fx)

[PUNCH-IN FX 2.0™](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/effects#11.7-punch-in-fx)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

holding down FX turns the pads into punch-in fx. punch-in fx are a super fast way of creating variations on your beat, each one adds a unique character and allows you to quickly perform with what you have created.

punch-in fx

hold (FX) and press the pads to trigger punch-in FX.

pressure sensitive

punch-in FX are pressure sensitive and can be combined.

[live input fx](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/effects#11.8-live-input-fx)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

plug something into the input jack and turn up the internal fx level to process it through the built in fx!

main

press (main) to enter the main mode.

input gain

turn the (KNOBX) knob to adjust the input volume.

send level

turn the (KNOBY) knob to adjust the internal fx send level.

[output](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133/effects#11.9-output)

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

tighten up your sound with the master compressor. adjust drive for a more pronounced compression effect and speed to decide how quickly the compressor should respond to the input signal.

output settings

press (SHIFT) and (FX) to enter the output settings (master compressor).

drive

turn the (KNOBX) knob to adjust the drive.

speed

turn the (KNOBY) knob to adjust the speed - try cranking this and hear what it does to your beat.

[return to index](https://teenage.engineering/guides/ep-133#index)

sometimes things don’t quite sit right and you need to put certain sounds in their place. other times you want to kick the bass in the face with the kick. that’s where sidechain comes in!

sidechaining on ko2 uses note triggers to engage the sidechain compressor, this means you can trigger the sidechain compressor even without sound and choose the exact length and shape.

sidechain

to open the sidechain settings press (SHIFT) and (FX) to enter the output settings (master compressor) then (plus).

select source

hold a group pad and select a sound to add it as a source for the sidechain.

select group

hold shift and press a group pad to add it as a destination for the sidechain.

length

turn the (KNOBX) knob to adjust length of the duck.

shape

turn the (KNOBY) knob to adjust the shape of the duck.
