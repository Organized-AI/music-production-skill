# House Track Production Session
## Tuesday, October 23, 2025 | 2:00 PM - 7:00 PM

### Session Metadata
- **Duration:** 5 hours
- **Tokens Used:** 425,000 / 450,000 (94%)
- **Efficiency Score:** Excellent
- **Hardware:** EP-133 K.O. II (100% uptime)

### Creative Decisions
1. **Kick Selection:** 808 Deep Kick chosen for classic house sound
   - Alternative considered: Acoustic Kick (more natural)
   - Rationale: 808 provides consistent low-end foundation

2. **BPM Lock:** 128 BPM confirmed
   - Sweet spot for house music
   - Allows crisp hi-hat patterns
   - Good for club playback

3. **Chord Progression:** Cm - Ab - Eb - Bb
   - Emotional and uplifting
   - Works well with 808 bass root notes
   - 4 bars per chord maintains interest

4. **Velocity Strategy:** Dynamic range 75-115
   - Humanized rather than quantized
   - Hi-hats: 80-105 (subtle variation)
   - Kick: 110 (consistent power)
   - Snare: 105 (slightly softer than kick)

### Technical Notes
- **MIDI Mapping:** Standard EP-133 layout maintained
- **Group Usage:** 
  - Group A: Kick (MIDI 36)
  - Group B: Snare (MIDI 50)
  - Group C: Hi-hats (MIDI 42, 46)
  - Group D: Bass & Melodic (MIDI 48, 75, 77)

### What Worked Well
✓ Clear session plan prevented decision paralysis
✓ Token budget tracking kept production moving
✓ Auto-pause feature saved context during unexpected break
✓ EP-133 hardware connection remained stable
✓ Sound library organization made selection efficient

### Areas for Improvement
→ Could reduce bass sound auditions (used 25K tokens)
→ Consider locking in lead sound faster (saved 15K tokens)
→ Next time: prepare chord progressions before session

### Next Session Preparation
- [ ] Review MIDI export in DAW
- [ ] Identify specific transition needs
- [ ] List any additional sounds needed
- [ ] Schedule Thursday afternoon (3 hours)
- [ ] Budget: 250K tokens

### Token Breakdown by Activity
| Activity | Tokens Used | Percentage |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Sound Selection | 145,000 | 34% |
| Pattern Creation | 120,000 | 28% |
| Arrangement Planning | 85,000 | 20% |
| Velocity/Timing Adjustments | 50,000 | 12% |
| Session Management | 25,000 | 6% |

### Key Learnings
1. Having a clear BPM target saves exploration time
2. Four-on-the-floor patterns are token-efficient
3. Deep Pad (MIDI 75) is excellent for house atmosphere
4. 5-hour sessions are ideal for complete foundation work
5. Leaving 25K token buffer enables stress-free finishing

## 🎯 How This Example Demonstrates Integration

This example shows:

1. **Pre-Session Planning:** cc-session-manager analyzes calendar and creates optimal schedule
2. **Token Budgeting:** Real-time tracking prevents running out mid-creative-flow
3. **Context Preservation:** Auto-pause and resume with full state restoration
4. **Progress Monitoring:** Hourly check-ins keep session on track
5. **Analytics:** Post-session insights for continuous improvement
6. **Multi-Session Planning:** Automatic suggestions for follow-up work

The integration makes music production with Claude Code:
- ✅ More predictable (no surprise token depletion)
- ✅ More productive (optimal scheduling around your life)
- ✅ More sustainable (multi-day projects stay organized)
- ✅ More insightful (learn from your workflow patterns)

**Try this workflow yourself!**

Just say: *"Schedule my first music production session"*
