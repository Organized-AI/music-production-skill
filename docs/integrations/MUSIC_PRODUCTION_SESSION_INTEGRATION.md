# Music Production Session Integration Guide
## CC Session Manager + EP-133 K.O. II Skill

This guide explains how to integrate the **cc-session-manager** skill with your **EP-133 K.O. II music production workflow** to optimize your Claude Code sessions for music creation.

---

## 🎯 Why Integrate Session Management with Music Production?

Music production with Claude Code is token-intensive because it involves:
- Real-time MIDI communication with hardware
- Pattern generation and sequencing
- Sound library searches and recommendations
- Genre-specific template suggestions
- Complex multi-step music creation workflows

**The cc-session-manager helps by:**
1. **Scheduling optimal 5-hour production sessions** around your calendar
2. **Predicting token usage** for extended music projects
3. **Automatically blocking time** when you're most creative
4. **Managing context** across multi-day production sessions

---

## 🎹 Typical Music Production Session Token Usage

### Light Session (~1 hour) - ~50K-100K tokens
- Connect to EP-133
- Browse sound library
- Create 1-2 simple patterns
- Quick beat sketch

### Standard Session (~2-3 hours) - ~150K-300K tokens
- Multiple pattern creation
- Genre template exploration
- Sound layering and dynamics
- Basic arrangement

### Deep Production Session (~5 hours) - ~400K-500K tokens
- Complete track production
- Multiple pattern variations
- Advanced sequencing
- Sound design experimentation
- Mixing and arrangement decisions

---

## 🔧 Integration Setup

### Step 1: Install Both Skills

**Music Production Skill:**
```bash
# Install EP-133 K.O. II skill
pip install git+https://github.com/Organized-AI/ep-koii-skills.git

# Copy SKILL.md to Claude skills directory
cp music-production-skill/SKILL.md ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/skills/ep133-music-production.md
```

**CC Session Manager Skill:**
```bash
# Copy cc-session-manager skill
cp /mnt/skills/user/cc-session-manager/SKILL.md ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/skills/cc-session-manager.md
```

### Step 2: Configure MCP Server

Add the EP-133 MCP server to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ep-133-koii": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "ep_koii_skills.mcp_server"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

**Config locations:**
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.config/Claude/skills/`

### Step 3: Prepare Your Environment

1. **Connect EP-133 Hardware**
   - Power on EP-133 K.O. II
   - Connect via USB-C cable
   - Verify MIDI connection

2. **Export iCal Calendar**
   - Export your calendar as `.ics` file
   - Place in accessible location for session manager

3. **Locate Claude JSONL Files** (optional)
   - Default location: `~/.claude/projects/`
   - Used for token prediction

## 🎵 Integrated Workflow Examples

### Workflow 1: Schedule This Week's Production Sessions

**Natural Language Request:**
```
"I want to work on music production with my EP-133 this week. 
Schedule optimal 5-hour Claude Code sessions around my calendar."
```

**What Happens:**
1. ✅ cc-session-manager analyzes your iCal calendar
2. ✅ Identifies free 5-hour blocks
3. ✅ Predicts ~400K-500K token usage per session
4. ✅ Creates calendar events for music production
5. ✅ EP-133 skill remains available during these sessions

**Example Output:**
```
📅 Music Production Sessions Scheduled:

Tuesday 2pm-7pm: Deep Production Session
- Estimated tokens: 450K
- Budget remaining after: 50K tokens
- EP-133 connected and ready

Friday 10am-3pm: Sound Design Session
- Estimated tokens: 400K
- Perfect for experimental work
- Fresh token budget

💡 Tip: Both sessions avoid your meetings and give you 
    uninterrupted creative time with full token budget!
```

---

### Workflow 2: Start a Planned Production Session

**When your scheduled session starts, simply say:**
```
"Start my music production session - connect to EP-133"
```

**What Happens:**
1. ✅ Verifies you're in a scheduled production block
2. ✅ Shows remaining token budget
3. ✅ Connects to EP-133 hardware
4. ✅ Loads sound library
5. ✅ Ready to create!

**Example Output:**
```
🎹 Music Production Session Active

⏱️  Session Time: 5 hours scheduled (until 7pm)
🪙 Token Budget: 450K available
🎛️  Hardware: EP-133 K.O. II connected
📚 Sound Library: 240+ sounds loaded

Ready to create! What genre are we producing today?
```

---

### Workflow 3: Multi-Day Project Planning

**For larger projects:**
```
"I'm working on a full EP - 5 tracks. Help me schedule 
production time over the next 2 weeks."
```

**What Happens:**
1. ✅ Analyzes 2-week calendar availability
2. ✅ Calculates total token needs (~2M tokens for 5 tracks)
3. ✅ Schedules multiple 5-hour sessions
4. ✅ Distributes work: 1 track per session
5. ✅ Accounts for Claude Code monthly limits

**Example Output:**
```
🎵 EP Production Plan (5 Tracks)

Week 1:
  Mon 1pm-6pm: Track 1 - House Beat
  Thu 2pm-7pm: Track 2 - Trap Pattern
  
Week 2:

- Schedule sessions at least 1 day in advance
- Ensure EP-133 is charged/powered
- Have project goals defined
- Review previous session's work

### 2. **During Session**
- Monitor token usage every hour
- Save patterns frequently
- Export MIDI before session ends
- Document creative decisions

### 3. **Post-Session**
- Update session notes in cc-session-manager
- Export final arrangements
- Plan next session based on progress
- Review token efficiency

### 4. **Token Optimization**
```
High Token Usage:
❌ "Show me every sound in the library"
❌ "Try 50 different pattern variations"
❌ "Recreate this entire track from scratch"

Efficient Token Usage:
✅ "Find 808 kicks in the library"
✅ "Create a house pattern at 128 BPM"
✅ "Adjust velocity on this snare pattern"
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Integration Issues

### Issue: Session Manager Not Recognizing Music Production Context

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify both skills are in correct location
ls ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/skills/

# Should show:
# - cc-session-manager.md
# - ep133-music-production.md
```

### Issue: EP-133 Connection Lost During Session

**Solution:**
1. Don't panic - session state is preserved
2. Check USB cable connection
3. Say: "Reconnect to EP-133"
4. Session continues with restored context

### Issue: Token Budget Running Low Mid-Session

**Solution:**
```
"Save current progress and create a continuation plan 
for my next session"
```

The cc-session-manager will:
- Export current state
- Schedule follow-up session
- Preserve all context
- Start fresh with new token budget
